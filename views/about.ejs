  <h1>About the Tool</h1>
  <p>The dCARE tool was created to enable physicians, pharmacists, nurses, patients and care providers to understand the types of contraindications from taking two or more mental health drugs at the same time. 
  Every year over hundreds of thousands of Americans are harmed because they mix drugs that are not compatible. This can cause adverse reactions including hospitalization and death. While physicians do their best to prevent contraindication of drugs, it can be time consuming to understand all of the possible effects. The time needed for research expands exponentially as the number of drugs taken by an individual increases. The dCARE tool is specifically design to help those who are taking or prescribing pharmaceuticals for mental health issues to understand if there are potentially adverse side effects from specific combinations of medicines. dCARE includes the ability to show contradictors for several medications at the same time. It is based on official FDA data, and reduces the research time substantially.</p>
<h2>Data Source</h2>
<p>The data in this tool is pulled directly from the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS). It includes data that came in from both mandatory and voluntary reporting.
You may learn more about FAERS here: <a href="https://open.fda.gov/data/faers/">https://open.fda.gov/data/faers/</a></p>
<h2>Limitations of the dCARE Tool</h2>
<p>Medications: At this stage, we includes a limited set of medications related to mental health. At a future stage, the tool will expand to include all medications tracked by the FDA for contraindication.</p>
<p>Timeline: Because medications change over time, we are showing contraindication data for the last 5 years. In a future phase we may add the ability to select the time period over which contra-indications have been measured.</p>
<p>Medical Advice Disclaimer: This tool should not be used as a substitute for medical advice from a physician. If you have questions about the data, the results, or any of the information you find in this too, please contact your physician to discuss the information directly.</p>
