Sprint Planning and Review Notes
Sprint 1 Review
Git repo set up along with domain for public site (agileBPA.forumone.com)
API key and routes
Initial discovery with Product Owner during Kickoff meeting
Set up continuous integration system

#Sprint 1 Retrospective
PO feels like we’re off to a good start, and that the UX and Dev team were both asking important questions to determine what solution the PO wants implemented for this Dataset

#Sprint 2 Review
Personas created (3)
Sketching exercise
More discovery with Product owner to define requirements for the solution using the adverse-effects dataset

Sprint 2 Retrospective
PO appreciates research to narrow down audiences
PO engaged with sketching exercise to conceptualize the prototype
PO excited to move on the Sprint 3
PO would like to do usability testing by end of Sprint 4 or 5 (Pharmacist and Physician)
Visual Designer disappointed with lack of testing so far, due to tight sprint schedule
Interaction designer feels better about the way the solution is coming together
Interaction designer likes being able to prototype the results via JS.fiddle

Sprint 3 Review
Style guide not done, but underway. 
Radar chart was created in JSFiddle. 
Wireframe version 1 complete, but iteration will be needed.
Readme file for Pool 1 underway, more info needed as project moves on

Sprint 3 Retrospective
Content Strategists believes that the radar chart may not be intuitive for end users - recommends using bar charts instead
Content Strategist believes that context is needed for figures (total numbers vs percentage) to not mislead users with data
Content strategist though that the use of UXPin is useful since it allows stakeholders to leave feedback
Content strategist doesn’t believe that users should select date range, and should use last 5 years of data instead. PO agrees.

Sprint 4 Review
Comp delivered by visual designer
UXPin link sent out for usability testing, but testers were unavailable during Sprint 4
Dev - Code deployed to production
Wireframes and prototypes updated on UXPin
Content being developed for the ‘about’ page

Sprint 4 Retrospective
Interaction Designer - Usability testing started, but we’d like to reach MVP state on Sprint 5
Product Owner impressed with progress, and appreciates group seeking feedback from people (Physician) on the UXPin prototype
PO impressed with documentation (Trello, Google Drive, Readme), but would like it more fleshed out by next sprint
Interaction designer concerned that functionality may be too narrow

Sprint 5 Review
Heavy development sprint, with various dev tasks accomplished. 
Reset button added
About page was added
Radio buttons added to allow search by either Brand or Substance
Brand and Substance data route added
Search limited to 3 drugs per query
Velocity was slower than other sprints

Sprint 5 Retrospective
PO: More usability testing needed
PO: disappointed that the MVP is not yet ready. Will deploy in Sprint 6
PM: Timing concerns due to inability of team to work at same time

Sprint 6 Review
More dev work completed during this sprint, with MVP launched at sprint end
Responsive theme added
Global header and footer added
Hallway usability testing occurred, with updated designs resulting from feedback

Sprint 6 Retrospective
Tech Lead: Throttling will take longer than expected to avoid errors if we exceed API limits per minute
PO: happy with usability testing results being incorporated rapidly into new design comps
PM: Happy to see MVP launched, although slower than anticipated

Sprint 7 Review
Sprint focused mostly on changes to data viewer
Chart updated to display data better, including labels and titles (feedback received from usability testing)
Design change in drug selection: chips put into place as opposed to forcing users to add new rows. 

Sprint 7 Retrospective
PO: Satisfied with development pace, but wants to see further usability testing and surveys to get user feedback on new look/functionality for the site
PM: Content development coming along well. Satisfied with clarification added to ‘about’ page
PM: Would still like to see options removed from the dropdown list if they have already been selected. Tech team having difficulty with this.
Designer: Would like to see some of the changes implemented from the mockups provided
