But, how much do you really know about where you live?</p>\n<p><strong><em>Do you know that according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States? Hereditary, lifestyle and behavior all play a part in who develops cancer. But, so does environment. In fact, as many as 67% of all cancer cases are linked to some type of environmental factor. Your kid’s soccer field, the local water park, your dad’s golf course, even the air you breathe may be putting you and your family at risk.</em></strong></p>\n<p>That’s why the National Cancer Institute has made the study of environmental-related cancer causes a top priority and is committed to helping the public learn more about the potential environmental cancer risks posed by their communities.</p>\n<h2>Neighborhood Scan</h2>\n<p>Forum One and Urban Design 4 Health are pleased to launch Neighborhood Scan—a powerful online tool to help educate local residents, real estate developers, urban planners and researchers about any known potential cancer-causing risk factors in their surrounding areas. Armed with this information, you’ll be better equipped to make important health-related decisions for your family, business and/or community at large.</p>\n<h3>Don’t wait!
