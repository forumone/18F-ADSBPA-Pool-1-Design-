#dCARE Usability Testing Responses

#### Daniel Ferro (June 24):

I recommend following the general layout in my designs
- Have the "ADD DRUG" button appear below the drop down items
- Use the white drop down item designâ€¦the current gray text on gray is hard to read
- Do not make the reset button so bright and prominent...it should be more subdued as in the design
- Remove "Select how to find your medicine" from the text...I feel it's over explaining. We already say "Choose Drugs", maybe it could even say 'Choose Drugs to Compare"
- When the page loads, there should be two drop down menus by default, and the "ADD MORE" link should read "ADD MORE DRUGS"
- If a user has selected Drug X, and then they select ADD DRUG, the drop down menu should no longer have Drug X as an option...since the whole point of this app is to compare two different drugs.
- I like that the drop down boxes have an "X" option to allow users to remove selected drugs
- The drug should update in the chart once a user select the drug in the drop down menu. Currently the only way the drug gets updated is if the user clicks 
- "ADD DRUG".."ADD DRUG" should really only add a new drop down menu, not be used as an 'apply my choice' button
- Color palette could be more vibrant and modern
- Logo looks simplistic. Lacks strong branding
- Color contrast makes it hard to read
- Dropdowns could be taller to be more finger-friendly and look more modern

A few comments:
- If I wear my medical hat, I don't really see anything that should be improved (other than maybe the order of items in the chart).
- It seemed to work well adding two drugs. Adding a third wasn't really coming up right for me. I am in China, so that might be an issue. It's cool functionality though.
- Adding some instructions on the opening page and perhaps a brief glossary below the chart might be useful.
- Image will matter a lot -- so it would be great (I expect this is your plan) to take this through a quick design step. Can you give it a cool name? (Drug Defender? Drug Bug?) and tagline (Analyze adverse reactions with drug combinations -- over !,000,000 combinations possible"). (That figure is for three drug interactions / there are 109 brands mentioned.) Also, the impression of the initial homepage is really important. Right now the most prominent item is a blank space with "no data available" -- it would be nice to default to something visually interesting that maybe changes once the charts start appearing?
- I'm happy to help with anything.

#### Elisabeth Urfer (June 21):

- I don't care about the number of people, I want the percentages.
- I want to know what this means for me
- Didnt realize you could click on or scroll over the bars
- I don't know what the "k" means. Later she said "I assume that is thousands, but was not obvious at first.
- What is the serious other, it doesn't tell me anything. We might want to help define these.
- "Looks like Zanax is really bad it causes a lot of death

#### Jim Cashel (June 20):

- Cool. Thanks for the note. Looks interesting.
- Are the terms you use ("serious death", "serious disabling") those found in the FDA database? It would be good to align these as closely as possible with the terms physicians would use (for example "serious death" probably isn't one :)    ).
- You also might order the severity of adverse effects: hospitalization, congenital, disabling, life-threatening, death, other.
- I'm also a little clear on first pass -- does the chart reflect predicted adverse effects *if* all four drugs are used simultaneously?
