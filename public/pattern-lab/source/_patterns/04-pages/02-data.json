The available data cover five broad categories relevant to cancer risk – demographics, built environment, chemical exposure, health services and cancer incidence. The initial set of Phase 1 data come from existing data sets made publicly available by a variety of federal agencies including – US Census, US Environmental Protection Agency and the National Cancer Institute (at the National Institutes of Health). These data are available at a variety of spatial scales, including street addresses, Census block groups and tracts, county, and state. The data are described below. Data anticipated to be added to Neighborhood Scan in Phase 2 are described after the Phase 1 data descriptions provided here.</p>"
